\feedback[\huge]{I've said it again and will say again. Will keep working with Elio. Awesome for LaTex}
\feedback{Elio is excellent with LaTeX and really blends functionality with design. We were on a tight deadline, his communication was of a very high standard and we have no hesitation in recommending him. Thank you for a really well delivered project. I hope we can work with you again soon.}
\feedback{Working with Elio has helped me in so many ways: Elio is clever and has an intimate knowledge of LaTeX, he has attention for detail and a feeling for what looks good, he is able to solve problems before they even come to your attention. Elio loves LaTeX.\\
He is also funny, easy to talk to and overall a great guy - just a pleasure.\\
Finally, he's worked mostly manual hours (not time logged in the work diary) and he has always logged very modest amounts of hours. Elio is extremely reliable and will never overcharge, if anything he undercharges.\\
He's been the best freelancer experience that I have had, and I will continue to work with Elio for a long time!}
\feedback[\huge]{Thank you Elio.}
\feedback{I needed Elio's expertise in Latex for converting a bunch of lyx file into dissertation latex with strict template. I had many big tables and Elio was able to change all of them nicely to fit within the margins.\\
Since this was an important job, I hired 2 other upwork workers besides Elio. The other two weren't able to deliver what I needed. Elio delivered what I needed in less than half the time the other people took and delivered 100\%! Where other two highly rated latex experts failed, Elio succeeded.\\
He really cares a lot about the work. THE BEST UPWORK person I've ever worked with!\\
HIRE THIS GUY!}
\feedback{Elio is the most thorough, meticulous and pleasant consultant I have worked with during my twenty-six years in the IT business. His work is of astonishing quality, exceeding my most ambitious expectations.}

\feedback[\huge]{It's not standard to work with such experts}
\feedback{Excellent work! Accurate, fast and even took initiative to make improvements not included on the original task. I am very happy to find someone who is genuinely interested in the quality of their work. Will certainly use again. Thank you.}
\feedback{Fantastic project!}
\feedback{Elio was excellent; he created a TikZ image based on a .png I sent him. I needed a few versions (i.e. with different elements selected). Elio implemented this as two function calls, one to plot and one to highlight, that allowed me to make minor adjustments (i.e. to the color scheme) to all of the figures at once (i.e. by tweaking parameters in the function) as I've further iterated on the slide deck. Furthermore, I posted this request on my way out of the office in the hopes of having a solution before the morning. Elio had the deliverable in my inbox within an hour. 10/10.}
\feedback{Great help from Elio! I will surely ask him for help again.}
