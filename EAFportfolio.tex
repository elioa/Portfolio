    \feedback[\huge]{Great help from Elio! I will surely ask him for help again.}
    \feedback{Was an absolute pleasure to work with Elio. He was extremely professional and knows his stuff. Would highly recommend him.}
    \feedback{Elio completed the conversion of a technical document from word to LaTeX. He completed the work extremely efficiently, and I was very pleased at all the extra suggestions he made and completed to make the document look as professional as possible. I highly recommend Elio and would have no hesitation in working with him again.}
    \feedback{Working with Elio was a very pleasant experience and I can highly recommend him for any LaTeX typesetting challenges and complex TikZ drawings. My project had a very tight deadline and he delivered on time and provided me with a great result. Great communication throughout the duration of the project.
    I will work with him again.}
    \feedback{Elio's great! Highly recommend. Thoughtful, prompt, and skilled!}
    \feedback[\huge]{He is a Latex Jedi.}
    \feedback{Elio was great to work with. He is very knowledgeable about LaTeX, gave a quality product, was friendly, and was very fast in completing the task. I would definitely work with him again or recommend him to my friends and colleagues.}
    \feedback{Best Latex expert with a great communication skills. I highly recommend him and I will keep using him.
    Thank you so much for the best latex edit.}
    \feedback{A wonderful latex expert! He did not just complete the work successfully but also answer my questions patiently. I highly recommend him.}
    \feedback{Elio is excellent with LaTeX and really blends functionality with design. We were on a tight deadline, his communication was of a very high standard and we have no hesitation in recommending him. Thank you for a really well delivered project. I hope we can work with you again soon.}
    \feedback[\huge]{Elio was really great to work with. He is a true LaTeX expert! Highly recommended.}
    \feedback[\huge]{I've said it again and will say again. Will keep working with Elio. Awesome for LaTex}
    \feedback{Working with Elio has helped me in so many ways: Elio is clever and has an intimate knowledge of LaTeX, he has attention for detail and a feeling for what looks good, he is able to solve problems before they even come to your attention. Elio loves LaTeX.\\
    He is also funny, easy to talk to and overall a great guy - just a pleasure.\\
    Finally, he's worked mostly manual hours (not time logged in the work diary) and he has always logged very modest amounts of hours. Elio is extremely reliable and will never overcharge, if anything he undercharges.\\
    He's been the best freelancer experience that I have had, and I will continue to work with Elio for a long time!}
    \feedback[\huge]{Thank you Elio.}
    \feedback{I needed Elio's expertise in Latex for converting a bunch of lyx file into dissertation latex with strict template. I had many big tables and Elio was able to change all of them nicely to fit within the margins.\\
    Since this was an important job, I hired 2 other upwork workers besides Elio. The other two weren't able to deliver what I needed. Elio delivered what I needed in less than half the time the other people took and delivered 100\%! Where other two highly rated latex experts failed, Elio succeeded.\\
    He really cares a lot about the work. THE BEST UPWORK person I've ever worked with!\\
    HIRE THIS GUY!}
    \feedback{Elio is the most thorough, meticulous and pleasant consultant I have worked with during my twenty-six years in the IT business. His work is of astonishing quality, exceeding my most ambitious expectations.}
    \feedback{Excellent work! Accurate, fast and even took initiative to make improvements not included on the original task. I am very happy to find someone who is genuinely interested in the quality of their work. Will certainly use again. Thank you.}
    \feedback[\huge]{It's not standard to work with such experts}
